========================================

a list is a sequence(s)
s = "abcd"
l = [22, 11, 33, 44]

talk about syntax
 - create a list
 - indexing [100, 200, 300][1]
 - for loop

for loop works for this too

CODING EXAMPLE: list_total function
 - tell them about sum, min, and max after

========================================

other things that work the same:
 - len
 - slicing
 - concatenation
 - in
 - multiply sequence by int

========================================

DIFF 1: flexible item types

l = [True, False, 3, "hey", [1, 2]]
for item in l:
  print(type(l))

talk about this: l[-1][-1]

========================================

DIFF 2: mutability

you can't change a string (immutable)
you can change a list (mutable)

s[i] = ... (ERROR!)

ways to change a list:
 - l[i] = ...
 - append
 - pop
 - sort

CODING EXAMPLE: calculate median

========================================

between lists and strings
 - l = list(s)
 - split
 - join

CODING EXAMPLE: profanity filter, replace "darn" with "****"

========================================

BONUS TOPICS IF TIME:
 - sys.argv
 - reverse list
 - random.choice
 - pass a reference by value...

Do this in PythonTutor:

def set_first(items, value):
    value = value +  1  # change value
        items[0] = value    # change items

l = [3, 2, 1]
x = 100
set_first(l, x)
print(x)  # value is not changed
print(l)  # l is changed
