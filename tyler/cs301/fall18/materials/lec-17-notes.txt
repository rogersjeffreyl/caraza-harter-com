a list is an example of a data structure

What is a data structure?  [wikipedia]

a data structure is a collection of data values,
the relationships among them,
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

========================================

Motivation for data structures
 - don't want to repeat code to perform more computation
 - don't want to create more variables to hold more data

========================================

talk about mappings
 - assign labels to values
 - label could be an "index", or a "key"
 - motivation for an alternative to lists:
   - what if we don't want consecutive ints?
   - what if we want floats or strings as labels?

========================================

introducing the dictionary
 - a mapping (like a list), but label (called a "key" instead of an "index" can be arbitrary)
 - naming: lookup word (key) in dictionary to get a definition (value)

========================================

dictionary operations
 - {}, {"key": "value"}
 - d[key]          # lookup
 - d[key] = value  # set/update
 - get, pop        # with defaults
 - len, in, for loop
 - d.keys(), d.values()

========================================

Examples:
 - per_year.py example (want holes in the data)
 - score.py example (want string labels instead of int labels)
 - wc.py example (talk about binning/bucketing)
 - translate.py (English to Spanish)
 - cache.py (remember result for is_prime)
