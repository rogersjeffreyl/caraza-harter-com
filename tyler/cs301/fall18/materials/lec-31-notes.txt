SQL Databases

========================================

SLIDES

DBs vs. simple files:
 - CSV -> one table of strings
 - Database -> collection of tables, with various (determined) types
   (in contrast to JSON)

Advantages of DBs:
 - query language (SQL)
 - sharing (tricky with just files)
 - performance (example)

Show table with two fields:
 - it's sorted by one of them
 - count values in a range (for each field)
 - time how long it takes

========================================

Popular SQL Databases:
 - SQL Server
 - Oracle Database
 - MySQL
 - PostgresSQL
 - SQLite

SQLite
 - comes with Anaconda
 - easy to use
 - several billion deployments
 - public domain

https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html
 - Every Android device
 - Every iPhone and iOS device
 - Every Mac
 - Every Windows 10 machine
 - Every Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browser
 - Every instance of Skype
 - Every instance of iTunes
 - Every Dropbox client
 - Every TurboTax and QuickBooks

========================================

DEMO

show webpage

sqlite3 bus.db
.tables
select * from routes;
select route_url from routes;
select * from boarding;
select * from boarding limit 10;
.schema

========================================

SLIDES

distinguish between SQLite commands and SQL queries

show output from .schema

what parts to look for?
 - identify tables
 - identify columns
 - identify column types

learn about queries:
 - select, from, semicolon
 - column names

limiting and sorting

where
 - watch out, only one equal sign

========================================

SLIDES: cheatsheet

========================================

Python modules learned this semester
 - math
 - collections
 - json
 - csv
 - sys
 - os
 - copy
 - sqlite3 <- today
 - recordclass
 - requests
 - bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
 - pandas

========================================

sqlite3 module

import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("filename.db")

cursor = conn.execute("SQL command")
for row in cursor:
    print(row) # each row is a tuple

conn.close()

========================================

EXERCISE:

Question: which bus route goes the farthest west?
 - bigger latitude is north
 - bigger longtitude is east
 - QUERY: what bus route takes you most West?
   select route, lon from boarding order by lon asc limit 1;

========================================

DEMO: query is faster than Pandas over CSV
