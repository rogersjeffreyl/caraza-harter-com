<h3 class="my-4">General Directions</h3>

<p class="lead">You can upload either a .py file or
  a .zip file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.  Only one partner
  is required to upload the project.  To make sure both partners
  receive credit, though, you must include the following comment
  somewhere in your code (replace YOUR-NETID and PARTNER-NETID with
  your respective NetIDs, the part before @wisc.edu in your campus
  email address):
</p>

<pre class="example">
# submitter: YOUR-NETID
# partner: PARTNER-NETID
</pre>

<p>Or, if you're working by yourself, just put the following line by
itself:</p>

<pre class="example">
# submitter: YOUR-NETID
# partner: none
</pre>
