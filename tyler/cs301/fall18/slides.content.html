<h3 class="mt-5">Code Examples</h3>

<p class="mb-5">
  Several students have asked me to post code examples I write in
  class.  I think it's better to watch these in person for several
  reasons: (1) I explain it as we go, (2) sometimes I'm giving an
  example of something that won't work, and (3) it makes sense to see
  something incrementally written than to just look at the final
  version.  That said, I'll dump some (but not all) of the examples
  on <a href="https://github.com/tylerharter/caraza-harter-com/tree/master/tyler/cs301/fall18/materials/code">GitHub</a>.
  Of course, please still come to lecture, and don't consider looking
  at the examples a substitute.  The examples here won't come with
  much explanation.  If there's something specific from lecture you
  want posted here that I didn't share, please drop me an email.  Or,
  feel free to come to office hours to discuss any example that didn't
  make sense to you in class.
