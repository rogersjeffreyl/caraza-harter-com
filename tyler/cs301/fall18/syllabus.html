<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Welcome to your first programming course, Data Programming (CS
  301)!  This course is intended as a gentle introduction to
  programming for students outside of computer science.  CS 301 will
  approach programming from a data-science perspective.  Despite being
  numbered in the three-hundreds, CS 301 assumes no programming
  background.  We will learn the basics about computers work, learn to
  program in the Python language, and write Python programs that work
  with interesting datasets.  CS 301 is a <i>data-centric</i>,
  <i>Python-based</i>, and <i>hands-on</i> introduction to
  programming.

<p><b>Data-Centric:</b> Many 301 students are majoring data-rich
  fields (e.g., mechanical engineering, psychology, economics, and
  many other quantitative fields).  Our emphasis will be on writing
  code to make use of datasets you will encounter in your various
  fields of study.  We will be writing code to extract information
  from data sources (in their many forms), run simple simulations, and
  create plots.  In contrast, introductory courses for computer
  science majors are less data centric, but delve deeper into topics
  such as object oriented programming and basic theory (e.g.,
  complexity analysis of algorithms).

<p><b>Python-Based:</b> Just as there are many languages for
  communicating with humans (e.g., English, Spanish, Hindi, etc),
  there are many languages for programming computers (e.g., Java, C++,
  Python).  Although Java is a very popular for teaching introductory
  programming, we will be using Python for several reasons.  (1)
  Python is
  becoming <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">increasingly
  popular</a>, making it a valuable career skill.  (2) Python is an
  easy language to learn and use; you'll type much less code relative
  to how much you would type to create equivalent programs in, say,
  Java.  (3) Python is very powerful, perhaps counter to expectations
  given its ease of use.  Python has been used to build large-scale
  web applications, such as reddit and Pinterest.  Extensions such as
  numpy (which we will cover in 301) make Python powerful and fast for
  various analytics.

<p><b>Hands-On:</b> CS 301 will be very hands-on and pragmatic.  At
  first, most students find programming slow and challenging.  As with
  learning a human language, becoming fluent in a programming simply
  requires lots and lots of practice.  We want you writing lots of
  code every week is CS 301.  Thus, instead of having a few large
  projects, we'll be giving smaller projects nearly every week.  We'll
  be providing lots of help and support for these projects; we're not
  trying to make the course difficult, we're trying to help you become
  proficient coders through practice.

<p>A detailed course schedule is
  available <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.  The schedule and content
  is subject to change based on student feedback and interests, so
  please check it often.


<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write basic Python code (conditionals, loops, functions; not OOP)
  <li>Use primary data structures (lists and dictionaries)
  <li>Work with various data formats (CSV, JSON, HTML; not XML)
  <li>Query SQL databases from Python
  <li>Generate plots
</ul>

<h3>Instructors</h3>

<p>This fall 2018, there will be three lecture sections and nine lab
sections.  Contact information and the typical office hour schedule
can be found on the <a href="people.html">people page</a>.  Deviations
to the regular office hour schedule can be found in
the <a href="calendar.html">Google calendar</a>.


<h3>Textbook (Free)</h3>

<p><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey, ISBN
9781491939369.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491939362">Amazon link</a>.
<a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Free download</a>.


<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>There are six ways we'll facilitate communication between
everybody (i.e., instructors, TAs, and students) this semester:

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> Any non-private questions you have that may be of
interest to other students should be posted
to <a href="https://piazza.com/wisc/fall2018/cs301/home">Piazza</a>.
This will help us avoid answering the same question many times for
different students.  Also, feel free to answer other student's
questions when you can.  This is a place for us all to learn from each
other.  <span class="text-danger">WARNING: don't post significant
chunks of project code (correct or otherwise) to Piazza.</span>  Small
snippets (e.g., &lt;6 lines) are OK, but giving away solutions to
graded work is cheating.  When in doubt, ask us privately whether it
is OK to post something.

<p><b>2. Email:</b> You should be automatically enrolled in either
compsci301-1-f18@lists.wisc.edu (for section 001) or
compsci301-2-f18@lists.wisc.edu (for section 002) or
compsci301-3-f18@lists.wisc.edu (for section 003).  We'll use these
lists for a few important announcements throughout the semester (e.g.,
before exams).  You cannot email these lists yourself.  You can,
however, <a href="people.html">email us directly</a>.  You can contact
all the TAs and instructors at once by
emailing <a href="cs301-ta@lists.wisc.edu">cs301-ta@lists.wisc.edu</a>.
This is appropriate for grading questions, or when you have a question
about your specific code (which should not be posted to Piazza).
  
<p><b>3. Feedback Form:</b> At the end of the semester, you'll be asked
to provide feedback on the course (materials, lectures, etc).  While
that end-of-semester feedback will be very helpful for us in future
semesters, it doesn't help you right now!  We encourage you to leave
feedback
with <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsqDSpP3HfQB4KhY-ND36-Y7KCRTZ5Q6o8PRWAe-EbWviQmQ/viewform">this
Google form</a> throughout the semester so we can fix any issues
quickly.  The form also gives you the option to share feedback with us
anonymously.

<p><b>4. Project Submission:</b> You will upload projects
using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  I (Tyler) developed
this tool over the summer, and this is the first semester it will be
used, so please directly share feedback with me regarding any
technical difficulties you encounter
(<a href="mailto:tylerharter@gmail.com">tylerharter@gmail.com</a>).
  
<p><b>5. Canvas:</b> This is a tool that can serve different purposes
in different courses.  We'll only be using Canvas as a way for us to
share
your <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/120690/gradebook">grades</a>
with you.  We'll upload both project and exam scores here (the only
two components of your grade).

<p><b>6. Clicker Questions:</b> As a lecturer, one of the most
important things for me to receive feedback on is pacing.  Are
students bored, and I should go faster?  Do I need to go slower and
give more examples?  In order to get this feedback, we'll be using a
<a href="clicker.html">clicker application</a> where I ask questions
during lecture and students submit their answers answers on their
phones or laptops.  If many students are getting a question wrong,
that will signal to me that I should slow down.  Note that your
answers here are not anonymous.
  
<h3>Lecture (Sections 1+2)</h3>

<p>We'll meet three times a week (MWF) for a 50 minute lecture.  I
(Tyler) will cover material with slides (which I'll
post <a href="slides.html">here</a> after lecture).  I'll also spend a
lot of time writing programming on-screen and talking through what I'm
doing to help you learn how to deconstruct a problem and turn it into
code.  Times/Locations:

<ul>
  <li><b>Lecture 001:</b> 8:50am (MWF) in Noland 132
  <li><b>Lecture 002:</b> 1:20pm (MWF) in Psychology 113
</ul>

<p>When I'm writing code in class, it will be very helpful for you to
follow along, so I highly encourage you to bring your laptops to
lecture.  I implore you, however, to use it for writing code, not
getting distracted!

<h3>Lecture (Section 3)</h3>
<p>We'll meet two times a week (TR) for a 75 minute lecture.<br/>
Times/Locations:
<ul>
  <li><b>Lecture 003:</b> 9:30am (TR) in Chamberlin 2241
</ul>

<h3>Lab</h3>

<p>Each lab section has about 56 students and will meet once a week
for 75 minutes.  Each lab section will be led by a TA.  The focus of
the lab sections will be to work on the weekly project (which is
always due Wed at midnight).  Usually this will be a flexible time
driven by student questions about the projects.  The TAs may also
present something that will be helpful for your project.

<p>The labs will have Windows desktops you can use, but feel free to
bring your own laptop if you so choose.  Times/Locations:

<ul>
  <li><b>Lab 311:</b> 1pm (Mon) in CS 1350
  <li><b>Lab 312:</b> 1pm (Mon) in CS 1370
  <li><b>Lab 313:</b> 11am (Mon) in CS 1350
  <li><b>Lab 321:</b> 11am (Mon) in CS 1370
  <li><b>Lab 322:</b> 2:30pm (Mon) in CS 1350
  <li><b>Lab 323:</b> 2:30pm (Mon) in CS 1370
  <li><b>Lab 331:</b> 2:30pm (Thu) in CS 1350
  <li><b>Lab 332:</b> 4pm (Thu) in CS 1350
  <li><b>Lab 333:</b> 2:30pm (Thu) in CS 1370
</ul>

<p>In order to sign onto the lab machines, you'll need
to <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/computer-sciences-account-activation">activate
your CS account</a>.</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p><b>Exams are worth 40% of your final grade.</b>  We'll have two
  midterms, each worth 10%, and a final worth 20%.  These are
  closed-book, closed-laptop exams.  The exams will be multiple-choice
  scantron.

<p>You will be allowed one 8.5-by-11 inch notesheet (handwritten or
  printed, both sides), which you must turn in with your exam.  Later
  material builds on earlier material, so the exams will be
  necessarily be cumulative.

<p>Times/Locations (for 001):

<ul>
  <li><b>Exam 1:</b> Thursday, October 4th, 7:15 pm - 9:15 pm @ Van Vleck B102
  <li><b>Exam 2:</b> Thursday, November 8th, 7:15 pm - 9:15 pm @ Van Vleck B102
  <li><b>Final:</b> December 19 @ 7:45am, BASCOM 272
</ul>

<p>Times/Locations (for 002):

  <ul>
    <li><b>Exam 1:</b> Thursday, October 4th, 7:15 pm - 9:15 pm @ Van Vleck B130
    <li><b>Exam 2:</b> Thursday, November 8th, 7:15 pm - 9:15 pm @ Van Vleck B130
    <li><b>Final:</b> December 19 @ 7:45am, INGRAHAM 19
  </ul>

<p>Times/Locations (for 003):

<ul>
  <li><b>Exam 1:</b> Thursday, October 4th, 7:15 pm - 9:15 pm @ Social Sciences 6210
  <li><b>Exam 2:</b> Thursday, November 8th, 7:15 pm - 9:15 pm @ Social Sciences 6210
  <li><b>Final:</b> December 19 @ 7:45am, BIOCHEM 1125
</ul>

<p>If you need special accomodations for exams (or other components of
the course), please let us know early in the semester.  More
information about McBurney is <a href="mcburney.html">here</a>.

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Projects are worth 60% of your final grade.</b>  There will 10
  graded projects, so there will be a project due most weeks.  The
  first 9 projects will be worth 5% each, and the final project (P10)
  will be worth 15%.  Each project will be due on a Wednesday at
  midnight and will be posted at least 1 week before the deadline.
  All the lecture material necessary to complete a project will have
  been presented by the Friday prior to the due date (at the latest).

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> You will have 10 late days, which you can use
  across projects at your own discretion.  For example, you could turn
  each of your 10 projects in one day late, or you could turn in one
  project 10 days late, and all the others on time.  Use your late
  days judiciously!  10 may sound like a lot, but remember you have as
  many projects as late days.  Furthermore, using a late day on, say,
  P5 will not change the deadline for P6 or subsequent projects.
  <span class="text-danger">NOTE: December 15th is a hard deadline for
  all projects; you may not use late days to submit anything after
  that date.</span>  If you find you're using a lot of late days early
  in the semester, I encourage you to meet with us sooner rather than
  later to discuss work habits and strategies for starting projects
  early.  Our hope is that this late day policy will give you
  flexibility, and not cause work to pile up for you later on.

<p><b>Partners:</b> You may work alone, or with one project partner of
  your choosing.  You can work with the same partner for many
  projects, or change partners at any point.  Feel free to partner
  with a student in any of the three sections (001, 002, or 003).  You
  should program in pairs (two people sitting in front of a screen at
  the same time).  Take turns driving (i.e., writing code) and giving
  advice.  The point of partners is to learn from your peers, not to
  do half the work.  Some exam questions will be specifically written
  to find cases where a one partner does the work and the other
  partner does not understand what is going on.

<p><b>Submission:</b> You can upload either a .py file or a .zip file
  for each project with the <a href="submission.html">submission
  tool</a>.  Only one partner is required to upload the project.  To
  make sure both partners receive credit, though, you must include the
  following comment somewhere in your code (replace YOUR-NETID and
  PARTNER-NETID with your respective NetIDs, the part before @wisc.edu
  in your campus email address):

<pre class="example">
# my-login: YOUR-NETID
# partner-login: PARTNER-NETID
</pre>

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  The reviewer (the TA) will comment on the quality/quantity of your
  documentation, how you name variables and functions, and whether
  there are more elegant solutions to the problem you are trying to
  solve.  Bad code reviews often rely on simple rules (e.g., put a
  comment before every method), whereas good code reviews are often
  more subjective, and a matter of taste.  Thus, code reviews will not
  be part of your grade, so TAs will be free to give useful feedback
  that does not fit well with a rubric.  I highly recommend to read
  your code reviews carefully and learn from them.

<p><b>Grading:</b> Grades will be based on automatic tests that we run.  We'll share
  the tests with you before the due date, so you should never be
  surprised by your grade.  Except for three situations, the tests
  will tell you exactly what your grade will be even before you hand
  in your code.  The exceptions are:

  <ol>
    <li><b>Cheating:</b> obviously if you cheated (e.g., copied
    another student's code), the tests are irrelevant, and you have
    much bigger things to worry about than your grade on a particular
    assignment.
    <li><b>Faking:</b> sometimes, we will specify that you solve a
    problem in a specific way (so that you learn a particular skill).
    If, upon inspection of your code, we see you solved the problem in
    a way that doesn't meet the project specification, you'll lose
    points on that project (even if our automatic tests already
    tentatively gave you a better score).  Or, if your code is written
    specifically to defeat the tests, you'll lose points
    (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">this
    wikipedia article</a> for an example of a defeat device in the
    real world).  For example, suppose your program is supposed to
    take the length of a square's side as input and then output the
    area of a square, and we have a test that verifies your program
    outputs 100 when we input 10.  If you submit a program that always
    outputs 100 (regardless of the input) because you know we only
    test with 10, you'll lose points.
    <li><b>Being a bad partner:</b> if your partner complains that you
    didn't do any work (or that you did all the work, refusing to let
    your partner write any code), you may lose points (we'll meet with
    you first to hear your side, of course).
  </ol>

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Don't cheat!  Details on what constitutes cheating in CS 301
are <a href="cheating.html">here</a>.

<p>Copying code from a student who is not your partner is definitely
cheating.  You can, however, copy small snippets of code from
stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
a list in python" and find a solution
  at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

<pre class="example">
  # code copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
  def median(lst):
    sortedLst = sorted(lst)
    lstLen = len(lst)
    index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

    if (lstLen % 2):
      return sortedLst[index]
    else:
      return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
</pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
When in doubt, ask us!
