<h2 class="my-3">Computer Setup</h2>

<h3 class="my-3">PyCharm</h3>

<p>Just like you can use different web browsers to view the same
  website (for example, Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer), you
  can also use different editor programs to write the same code.  If
  you have a preference, you can use whatever editor you like for this
  course.  We realize most of you will have never used an editor,
  though, and will not have a preference.  In that case, we recommend
  PyCharm to you.  We have installed PyCharm on all the lab computers,
  so you can use it there, or install it on your own computer.</p>

<p>The first time you run PyCharm (in the lab or on your computer), it
needs to do some initial setup that is very slow, and can take 10+
minutes.  Just be patient (wait if it says something like "indexing"
  or "creating skeletons" or "2 processes running" in the status bar).</p>

<p>Once it's done doing that, you can create new projects where you
  can write Python code.  The following (unfortunately grainy) video
  shows how to create a Python file and run it in PyCharm.  Each
  computer is different and requires slightly different steps, so if
  you get stuck, visit one of the TAs or your instructor during office
  hours for help, and we'll be happy to work through the details with
  you.</p>

<h3 class="my-3">Installing Visual Studio Code on Windows</h3>

<p>Visual Studio Code is an alternative to PyCharm.  If you want to
use it, feel free.  Here are some videos where we are installing it
and configuring it.  We think PyCharm is easier for beginners, but
both are reasonable options.
