<h1 class="mt-5">CS 320: Data Programming II</h1>

<p>
  This is the follow-on course to CS 301.  I'll teach it in spring,
  when it will be offered for the first time.  This is the next
  logical course to take if you want to continue with Python and Data
  Science.

<h1 class="mt-5">CS 200: Programming I</h1>

<p>If you want to learn another programming language (Java), you might
consider taking this course.  CS 200 is the intro to the CS 200/300/400
sequence taken by all CS majors and assumes no programming background.

<p>
  If you did well in CS 301 (say, you got an A) and your good and
  pickup up skills on your own, you might consider skipping CS 200 and
  jumping straight into CS 300.  We
  wrote <a href="materials/cs300.pdf">some notes</a> to walk you
  through some of the trickier differences between Python and Java.
