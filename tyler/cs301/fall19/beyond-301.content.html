<h1 class="mt-5">Stay in Touch</h1>

<p>
  Always feel free to drop me an email at tylerharter@gmail.com.  I
  like to hear what you're up to, and I'm usually happy to give coding
  advice if you're working on an interesting programming project in
  the future.

  If you're interested in ever being a Shelf mentor, getting a
  certificate in Data Science, or helping the City of Madison by
  analyzing their
  data, <a href="https://forms.gle/7bjerXdFwZkB2puS8">fill this
  form</a> so I can keep you updated.

<h1 class="mt-5">Data Science Major</h1>

<p>
  I'm really excited about this new major!  Great option if you like
  coding and stats (would also make a good double major).  Check out
  the <a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/undergraduate-data-science-studies/">tentative
  requirements</a>.  There might be a certificate at some point too.
</p>

<h1 class="mt-5">CS 320: Data Programming II</h1>

<p>
  This is the follow-on course to CS 301.  I'll teach it in spring,
  when it will be offered for the first time.  This is the next
  logical course to take if you want to continue with Python and Data
  Science.  <a href="https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs320/s20/schedule.html">Check it out</a>.
</p>

<h1 class="mt-5">CS 638: Data Science in the City of Madison</h1>

<p>
  Only experience required is CS 301.  I'll probably teach it a again
  next fall.  Let me know if you're interested.  <a href="https://wisc-ds-projects.github.io/f19/projects.html">Check it out</a>.
</p>

<h1 class="mt-5">Shelf Mentor</h1>

<p>
  We'll probably hire more near end of spring (pays $13/hour).  Let me
  know if you're interested by filling above form.
</p>

<h1 class="mt-5">CS 200: Programming I</h1>

<p>If you want to learn another programming language (Java), you might
consider taking this course.  CS 200 is the intro to the CS 200/300/400
sequence taken by all CS majors and assumes no programming background.

<h1 class="mt-5">CS 300: Programming II</h1>

<p>
  If you did well in CS 301 (say, you got an A) and your good and
  pickup up skills on your own, you might consider skipping CS 200 and
  jumping straight into CS 300.  We
  wrote <a href="materials/cs300.pdf">some notes</a> to walk you
  through some of the trickier differences between Python and Java.
</p>

<h1 class="mt-5">Workshops</h1>

<p>
  DoIT offers various free workshops that you can register
  for <a href="https://at.doit.wisc.edu/events/">here</a>.
