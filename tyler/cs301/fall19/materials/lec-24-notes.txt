PART 1: Function References

Coding demos:
 1. show functions as aliases, and how we can reassign (f, g, h)

 2. call_n_times(f, n)
   - arg->param is like assignment
   - print hello x10
   - quiz game

 3. apply_to_each(f, items)
   - double
   - square
   - absolute
   - string -> int
   - talk about map()

PART 2: Function References

BONUS:

List of functions (a TODO list)
 - each function asks a question
 - pop one at a time until finished

unpacking, enumerate(), zip()
