      <h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to your first programming course!  CS 301 (Data Programming
  I) is a gentle introduction to coding for students outside of
  computer science.  Our goal is simple: to write Python code to
  answer questions about real datasets.  CS 301 will require you to
  practice coding a lot this semester (you'll complete 10 programming
  projects)!  It's a lot of work, but if you take this course
  seriously and invest the time, you'll walk away with an incredible
  new skill: the ability to make computers work on your behalf.

  <h3 class="mt-3">Additions To Syllabus Made During Semester</h3>

    <h4 class="mt-3">New Resubmission Rules (Oct 10)</h4>
  <h5 class="mt-3">Simple Resubmits: applies if it's <2 weeks past the deadline and test.py previously gave 80+ when we ran it</h5>
<ul>
<li> anybody (instructor, TA, or mentor) can help you with the regrade, but only in person (e.g., at office or Shelf hours).  You'll need to walk us through the changes you made and describe how they address previous feedback (if any)
<li> work with us to get a resubmission graded and an extension recorded (so it doesn't count as late)
<li> you generally won't receive feedback comments on resubmits
<li> caveats: everything must be resolved by Dec 13th at the latest; P4 and prior can be fixed the "simple resubmit" way through Oct 16th (regardless of normal 2-week constraint)
  </ul>

<h5 class="mt-2">Approval Process for Other Resubmits:</h5>
  <ul>
<li> work with your main TA via <a href="https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/fall19/status.html">email</a>
<li> they'll allow resubmits in a reasonable time frame if you lost points from test.py for trivial reasons
<li> if it seems like you might be falling behind in the course, they'll refer you to the instructor (Tyler) to decide whether you can resubmit
<li> followup to make sure extension is recorded!
  </ul>

<p>After a resubmission, please wait a week for us to sync before Canvas before you check again.  We don't take off points for resubmissions.</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll assign readings from three main sources this semester (all free).  Stay on top of them!</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey: <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i> by Al Sweigart: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Read Online</a>
  <li>Course Notes (we'll sometimes write these ourselves)
</ul>

<h3>In-Person Help</h3>

There are a few ways to get in-person help:
<ul>
  <li>Ask a TA or mentor for help during your lab session
  <li>Drop in to see me or a TA during our office hours.  Check our <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jzkcu4am8lmc3?cid=6">weekly schedule</a> before visiting because times/location might change from week to week (though we'll try to keep it regular)
  <li>Email me at tylerharter@gmail.com to schedule an appointment outside of office hour time
  <li>Visit peer mentors at the Shelf; these are undergrads who recently took (and did well in!) CS 301
</ul>

<p>The peer mentors will hangout out here (in the CS building, above the doors leading out towards Union South, to the left):

<p>
<img src="img/shelf.png" />

<p>The Shelf will staffed with CS 301 mentors Sunday (2-8pm) and
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (3-9pm).  Please don't ask non-301
mentors at the Shelf for help because they're only hired to help with
other courses (many don't know Python).

<h3>Online Communication</h3>

<p>There are five ways we'll facilitate communication between
everybody (i.e., instructors, TAs, and students) this semester:

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> You can ask questions (and see the other
questions) <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jzkcu4am8lmc3">here</a>.  <span class="text-danger">Do
not post code snippets that are &gt;5 lines long, that's considered
cheating.</span>

<p><b>2. Email:</b> You'll received announcement emails on the
compsci301-1-f19@lists.wisc.edu or compsci301-2-f19@lists.wisc.edu
course list.  Sometimes you'll also receive email from
  no-reply@caraza-harter.com.

<p>If you have a question that's not appropriate for piazza (e.g.,
something personal, or a question that involves attaching your code),
send an email to your TA; you can <a href="status.html">lookup their
email here</a>.  If they don't respond within 48 hours, feel free
to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/sending-an-email-to-multiple-recipients-cc-and-bcc-1171178">CC
me</a> at tylerharter@gmail.com.  I get a LOT of emails in a class
this size, so I'll prioritize responding to students who I see tried
to get an answer from a TA first.  Of course, it's OK for you to
contact me directly first if that's more appropriate for your
particular question.

<p><b>3. Class Forms:</b> We have <a href="surveys.html">various
forms</a> for you to tell us things.  The most important forms are (1)
a background form, so we can know a bit more about who is taking the
course, (2) an anonymous feedback form, where you can bring our
attention to any issues with the course, and (3) forms to report
exam conflicts.

<p><b>4. Code Review:</b> You will upload projects
using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  Via the same tool, TAs
will leave comments on your code.  <span class="text-danger">Even
projects scoring 100% often have a lot of room for improvement, so
please take these seriously</span>.  When submitting, you can ask for
specific kinds of feedback, based on what coding skills you're most
interested in developing.
  
<p><b>5. Canvas:</b> We'll periodically upload grades
  to <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/169767/gradebook">Canvas</a>.
  Otherwise, there's nothing interesting there (all the course
  contents are public on this site).

<h3>Lab</h3>

<p>Each week, we'll post a lab document with exercises you can work on
to solidify what we've covered in class.  Sometimes we'll also
introduce topics we didn't have time for in lecture.  The emphasis
will usually be on preparing for the project,
so <span class="text-danger">make sure you work through the weekly lab
before asking us for help on the project</span>.

<p>Lab exercises are ungraded, and you're free to do them from home.
However, we encourage you to do them during your scheduled lab time.
This gives you an opportunity meet other 301 students and to get help
from the TAs and mentors running the lab.  You can also use this time
to ask questions about the projects or other course material if you
like.

<p>We encourage you to work on your own laptops, but the labs have
some Windows desktops you can use if you prefer.  In order to sign
onto the lab machines, you'll need
to <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/computer-sciences-account-activation">activate
your CS account</a>.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Grading is based on the following:

  <ul>
    <li>Participation: 1%
    <li>P1 (Project 1): 1%
    <li>P2: 4%
    <li>P3: 4%
    <li>P4: 4%
    <li>P5: 4%
    <li>P6: 4%
    <li>P7: 4%
    <li>P8: 8%
    <li>P9: 8%
    <li>P10: 8%
    <li>Exam 1: 15%
    <li>Exam 2: 15%
    <li>Final Exam: 20%
  </ul>

<p>Participation is based on your online engagement (e.g., filling out
the "Who are You?" survey).  We'll give more details throughout the
semester.  Projects primarily focus on your ability to write code,
while exams focus more on your ability to read code.

<p>At the end of the semester, we'll look at the distribution of
scores and set a curve, with thresholds for each letter grade.  When
setting the curve, we'll guarantee the following:

  <ul>
    <li>at least 95% guarantees an <b>A</b>
    <li>at least 85% guarantees a <b>B</b> (or better)
    <li>at least 70% guarantees a <b>C</b> (or better)
    <li>at least 60% guarantees a <b>D</b> (or better)
  </ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>Exams are closed-book and closed-laptop.  The exams will be
  multiple-choice scantron (use a #2 pencil).  They are cumulative.

<p>You will be allowed one 8.5-by-11 inch notesheet (may be printed or
  written on both sides), which you must turn in with your exam.

<p>If you need special accomodations for exams (or other components of
  the course), please let us know.  We'll do our best to accomodate you.
  More information about McBurney is <a href="mcburney.html">here</a>.
  
<p>Exam Times:

<ul>
  <li><b>Exam 1:</b> Friday, Oct 4 @ 7:15-9:15pm
  <li><b>Exam 2:</b> Wednesday, Nov 6, 7:15-9:15pm
  <li><b>Final:</b> Thursday, Dec 19 @ 7:25-9:25pm
</ul>

<p>Find your location <a href="status.html">here</a> (don't assume
students in the same section will be in the same room).  Report any
exam conflicts at least 10 days in
advance <a href="surveys.html">here</a>.

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> You will have 7 late days, which you can use
  across projects at your own discretion.  You may use all your late
  days on the same project, if you like.  Using late days on a project
  does not defer the deadline for subsequent projects, so be careful
  not to let work pile up.  You <b>may not</b> use late days on the
  last project.  Late days are automatically applied if a project is
  turned in late (you may reclaim late days by withdrawing earlier
  projects).  After late days are exhausted, anything late will
  receive zero credit by default.  Please talk to me if you're falling
  this far behind.

<p><b>Partners:</b> You may work alone, or with one project partner of
  your choosing.  You can partner with different people for different
  projects if you like.  You may also partner with people in a
  different section of CS 301.  You and your partner should program in
  pairs (two people sitting in front of a screen at the same time).
  Take turns driving (i.e., writing code) and giving advice.  The
  point of partners is to learn from your peers, not to do half the
  work.  Some exam questions will be specifically written to find
  cases where a one partner does the work and the other partner does
  not understand what is going on.

<p><b>Submission:</b> You will upload either a .py file or a .ipynb
  (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.  Only one partner
  should upload the project on behalf of both people.  If you have any
  issues using the tool, make sure you're using the latest version of
  Chrome, because that is the only browser I support (and if that
  doesn't work, I'll help you troubleshoot).

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be based on automatic tests
  that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due date, so
  you should rarely be surprised by your grade.  Here are the cases
  where you might get a different final grade than what you see when
  you run the tests:

  <ol>
    <li><b>Configuration Issues:</b> There are ways to write code that
      will only work on certain computers (e.g., Windows but not on a
      Mac).  We'll talk about these cases in class and teach you to
      write code that should be able to run anywhere.  If you make a
      mistake that makes the tests fail for us even though you passed
      them yourself, we'll let you resubmit a corrected version (in a
      timely fashion).
    <li><b>Randomness:</b> There are some bugs in code that don't
      causes problems every time, resulting in tests sometimes failing
      and sometimes passing.  As in the "Configuration Issues" case,
      we'll work with you to let you fix the issue.
    <li><b>Cheating:</b> obviously if you cheated (e.g., copied
      another student's code), the tests are irrelevant, and you have
      much bigger things to worry about than your grade on a particular
      assignment.
    <li><b>Faking:</b> sometimes, we will specify that you solve a
      problem in a specific way (so that you learn a particular skill).
      If, upon inspection of your code, we see you solved the problem in
      a way that doesn't meet the project specification, you'll lose
      points on that project (even if our automatic tests already
      tentatively gave you a better score).  Or, if your code is written
      specifically to defeat the tests, you'll lose points
      (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">this
        wikipedia article</a> for an example of a defeat device in the
      real world).  For example, suppose your program is supposed to
      take the length of a square's side as input and then output the
      area of a square, and we have a test that verifies your program
      outputs 100 when we input 10.  If you submit a program that always
      outputs 100 (regardless of the input) because you know we only
      test with 10, you'll lose points.
    <li><b>Being a bad partner:</b> if your partner complains that you
      didn't do any work (or that you did all the work, refusing to let
      your partner write any code), you may lose points (we'll meet with
      you first to hear your side, of course).
  </ol>

<p>Project grading is <b>results-oriented</b>.  That means it doesn't
matter how much effort you put it; it only matters how well your code
works.  This means it is essential that your code runs.  If we can't
run your code for a project, you'll get a zero on that project,
because the tests will fail.  We'll never fix the code for you, and
we'll never manually give a better grade for code that "looks" almost
correct.

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  This
  may not be obvious to people taking a CS course for the first time,
  so everybody should read this.  The most common form of academic
  misconduct in these classes involves copying code for programming
  projects.  Here's an overview of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
<ul>
  <li>any collaboration with your project partner
  <li>talking about code (without looking at it or reading it aloud) with anybody
  <li>sharing pseudocode/diagrams with anybody
  <li>pointing friends to online resources (Piazza, Stackoverflow, etc.)
  <li>doing worksheets with friends
  <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
</ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
<ul>
  <li>looking at somebody else's project code and typing it line-by-line
  <li>copying/pasting code to/from a non-partner (with or without citation)
  <li>emailing your code to another student
  <li>taking pictures of project solutions
</ul>

<p>One action that students wonder about is whether it's acceptable to
LOOK at another student's code.  While this is not strictly forbidden,
it's often dangerous.  Many students find it difficult to look without
ultimately copying.  What's somewhat safer is when a student who has
completed a problem looks at the code of a student still working on
the problem.  In this case, the more-advanced student can often
provide useful advice and debugging tips that help the less-advanced
student without causing the less-advanced student to copy code.  Just
make sure the more-advanced student isn't telling the less-advanced
student exactly what to type, line by line.

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with 600+ students, it's
hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
a list in python" and find a solution
at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

<pre class="example">
  # copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
  def median(lst):
    sortedLst = sorted(lst)
    lstLen = len(lst)
    index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

    if (lstLen % 2):
      return sortedLst[index]
    else:
      return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
</pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
completely transparent about what you're doing.

<h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>

<p>Sometimes students who have done well in CS 301 later ask me for
recommendation letters, for grad school etc.  Unfortunately, getting
an A in class isn't enough for me to write a great letter.  Such
did-well-in-class letters (often dismissively called DWIC letters) are
typically ignored by those reading them, in part because they're
redundant with your transcript.

<p>If you're thinking about asking me to write you a letter, you
should do an interesting coding project outside of CS 301 and demo it to
me sometime so I'll have something to write about.  If your scores in
CS 301 are really phenomenal (e.g., you are in the top 1-2% of
students), I might agree to write you a letter even if I haven't seen
any other work you've done, but it still won't be as good as if you
show me something cool you've done in Python beyond 301.
