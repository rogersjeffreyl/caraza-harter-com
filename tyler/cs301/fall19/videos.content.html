<h1 class="mt-5">Videos</h1>

<p>Often I'll record section 2 lectures and post
them <a href="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/channel/CS301+-+F19/129948022">here</a>.
This is for review only. The video quality is not great, and sometimes
I won't post them (I won't let you know in advance), so don't treat
this as an alternative to attending lecture in person.

<p>Other videos:
