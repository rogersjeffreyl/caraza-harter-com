  If you enjoyed CS 301, you may want to take more CS courses.  Many
  courses have CS 400 as a prerequisite, which in turn has CS 300 as a
  prerequisite.  To take CS 300, you need to have taken either CS 200
  (Java) or this course, CS 301 (Python), so CS 300 is probably a good
  next course for you to take.  To help you switch from Python to
  Java, we created <a href="materials/cs300.pdf">some notes</a> to
  walk you through some of the trickier differences.
