<h1 class="mt-5">Welcome to Data Programming!</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Do you have interesting datasets you would like to analyze, but
  don't have any background programming?  Then CS 301 is for you!
</p>

<p>
  We'll teach you how to write Python 3 programs that will process
  data in a variety of formats and produce interesting results and
  plots.  Python is a fun but powerful language.  It's concise (you
  won't have to type too much, at least relative to other languages
  like Java) and popular (knowing Python is a good career skill).
</p>

<p>
  We believe the only way to get good at programming is lots of
  practice.  We assume you don't have any programming background and
  will start from the basics, but CS 301 will still be a serious time
  investment.  You'll have a programming project due nearly every
  week, but we'll be sure to provide lots of support (in the form of
  lab time, ample office hours, and online Q/A with Piazza).  By the
  end of the semester, we hope you'll loving programming as much as we
  do, and will be able to produce code with a certain level of ease.
