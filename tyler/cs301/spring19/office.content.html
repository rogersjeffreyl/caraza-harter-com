<h1 class="mt-5">Office Hours</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Learning programming for the first time often involves asking
  questions in person, so we're prioritizing creating lots of office
  hours every week.  We'll keep the office hour schedule
  updated <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jqa9nnsyjx778j">here on
  Piazza</a> (it may change without an announcement, so please check
  it often).
</p>

<p>We're also sometimes available to schedule meetings outside of
office hours.  Just drop us an email!</p>

<p>Here are some tips for making the most of office hours:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bring your laptop so you can show us your code
    <li>Tell us what you thought your code should do, and explain how
      it's different than what it is doing
    <li>Debugging is an experimentation process, so please tell us a
    couple things you tried, and the results
    <li>Expect us to ask you questions!  More than just trying to help
    you solve a particular problem, we're trying to help you think
    like a programmer.  So even if we see the answer, we might ask you
    questions (that you will eventually learn to ask yourself) to help
    you discover the solution on your own
  </ul>
