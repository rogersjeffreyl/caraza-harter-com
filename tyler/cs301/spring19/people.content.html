  Learning programming for the first time often involves asking
  questions in person, so we're prioritizing creating lots of office
  hours every week.  We'll be posting times/locations soon.  Here are
  some tips for making the most of office hours:

  <ul>
    <li>Bring your laptop so you can show us your code
    <li>Tell us what you thought your code should do, and explain how
      it's different than what it is doing
    <li>Debugging is an experimentation process, so please tell us a
    couple things you tried, and the results
    <li>Expect us to ask you questions!  More than just trying to help
    you solve a particular problem, we're trying to help you think
    like a programmer.  So even if we see the answer, we might ask you
    questions (that you will eventually learn to ask yourself) to help
    you discover the solution on your own
  </ul>
