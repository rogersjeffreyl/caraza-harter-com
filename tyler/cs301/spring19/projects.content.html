<h1 class="mt-5">Projects</h1>

<h3 class="my-4">General Directions</h3>

<p class="lead">You can upload either a .ipynb or .py file (as
  specified) for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.  Only one partner
  is should upload the project on behalf of both.
</p>

<p>Every project should have the following at the top of the code:</p>

<pre class="example">
# project: PROJECT
# submitter-netid: NETID1
# partner-netid: NETID2
</pre>

<p>For project 1, replace "PROJECT" with "p1"; for project 2, with
"p2", etc.  Replace "NETID1" with the Net ID of the person doing the
submission (your Net ID is the part before "@wisc.edu" in your student
email address).  Relpace "NETID2" with the Net ID of the other
partner.  If the project was done solo, replace "NETID2" with "none"</p>
