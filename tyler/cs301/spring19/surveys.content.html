<h1 class="mt-5">Surveys</h1>

<p>We may ask you to fill out various feedback forms throughout the
  semester.  For non-anonymous forms, we will often require you to
  fill in this form using your "@wisc.edu" signin; this allows us to
  verify who you are.  If you try using a different signin on one of
  these, you'll see an error saying "You need permission: This form
  can only be viewed by users in the owner's organization."  If Google
  automatically signs in for you, please open the link in a "New
  Incognito Window" in Chrome.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/WtWRjr7qFt4jYfEV2" target="_blank">1. Who are you?</a>  To help us better understand who is
taking this class, please fill this out (required).  This is not
anonymous, and we'll correlate this with your scores this semester to
make sure the class is the appropriate difficult level for our target
audience (students completely new to programming).</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/2w7JujJrg9cKGtYj2" target="_blank">2. Feedback Form.</a>  If you have any issues with the
class or suggestions for improvement, please let us know sooner rather
than later; we may be able to make changes more rapidly than you might
imagine.  This is optionally anonymous, but it's always nice to know
who you are (sometimes it makes sense to have followup
  conversations).</p>
