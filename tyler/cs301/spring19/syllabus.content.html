<h1 class="mt-5">Syllabus</h1>

<p>Welcome to your first programming course!  CS 301 (Data
  Programming) is a gentle introduction to programming for students
  outside of computer science.  Our goal is simple: learn to write
  Python code to answer questions about real datasets.  CS 301 will
  require you to practice coding a lot this semester (you'll complete
  10 programming projects)!  It's a lot of work, but if you take this
  course seriously and invest the time, you'll walk away with an
  incredible new skill: the ability to make computers work on your
  behalf.

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write basic Python code (conditionals, loops, functions)
  <li>Use primary data structures (lists and dictionaries)
  <li>Work with various data in various forms (CSV, JSON, HTML, SQL Databases)
  <li>Analyze tabular data with Jupyter notebooks
  <li>Communicate visually with plots
</ul>

<h3>Teachers</h3>

Caroline Hardin is the instructor for section 1 and Tyler
Caraza-Harter is the instructor for sections 2 and 3.  There will also
be 10 TAs.  There are more details on the <a href="people.html">people
page</a>.

<h3 class="mt-3">Readings</h3>

<p>We'll assign readings from three main sources this semester (all free).  Stay on top of them!</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Think Python 2nd Edition</i> by Allen B. Downey: <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">Read Online</a>
  <li><i>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</i> by Al Sweigart: <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Read Online</a>
  <li>Course Notes (we'll sometimes write these ourselves)
</ul>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>There are five ways we'll facilitate communication between
everybody (i.e., instructors, TAs, and students) this semester:

<p><b>1. Piazza:</b> A public question/answer forum for you to get help.
<a href="https://piazza.com/wisc/spring2019/cs301/home">Link</a>.  <span class="text-danger">WARNING:
don't publicly post significant chunks of project code (even if the
code doesn't work) to Piazza.</span>  That's considered cheating.
Small snippets (5 lines max) are OK.  When in doubt, seek help
individually.

<p><b>2. Email:</b> We'll use these lists (one for each section) to
send general announcements: compsci301-1-s19@lists.wisc.edu,
compsci301-2-s19@lists.wisc.edu, and compsci301-3-s19@lists.wisc.edu.
You cannot email these lists yourself.  We'll also send personalized
auto-generated emails from no-reply@caraza-harter.com; in particular,
we'll send you project feedback and records of your exam scantron
answers from this email.  If you want to email us (instructors or
TAs), you can do so indivdually, or send mail to all of us at
 <a href="cs301-ta@lists.wisc.edu">cs301-ta@lists.wisc.edu</a>.
  
<p><b>3. Feedback Form:</b> Our goal to to make fast corrections to
any issues that may arise during the semester.  To help with this, please send us feedback via this 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsqDSpP3HfQB4KhY-ND36-Y7KCRTZ5Q6o8PRWAe-EbWviQmQ/viewform">
Google form</a>.  The form lets you share anonymous feedback, but
we're grateful when you choose to share your name (it gives us a
chance to respond and discuss further).

<p><b>4. Code Review:</b> You will upload projects
using <a href="submission.html">this tool</a>.  Via the same tools,
TAs will leave comments on your code.  In general, the comments will
suggest ways for you to write better code and save effort in the
future, so we highly recommend you read these.
  
<p><b>5. Canvas:</b> We'll periodically upload grades
  to <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/142227/gradebook">canvas</a>.
  Otherwise, there's nothing interesting there (all the course
  contents are public on this site).

<h3>Lab</h3>

<p>Labs will give you time to practice what what have covered in
lecture.  While labs are not themselves graded, the purpose is to
prepare you to do the projects on your own time.  The labs will be
self-guided, but there will be at least one TA there (usually two) to
help answer any individual questions that you may have.

<p>The labs will have Windows desktops you can use, but feel free to
bring your own laptop if you so choose.  There are not enough lab
computers for everybody, so please work in pairs during this time.

<p>In order to sign onto the lab machines, you'll need
to <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/account_management/computer-sciences-account-activation">activate
your CS account</a>.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>You'll receive a score in the course based on three things: exams
(50%), projects (49%), and participation (1%).

<p>The <b>exams</b> will include two midterms (each worth 15%) and one
final (worth 20%).

<p>There will be ten <b>projects</b>, the names of which we'll abbreviate (e.g.,
"P3" is "Project 3").  The weight is 1% for P1, 4% each for P2-P7, and
8% each for P8-P10.

<p>It is hard to judge <b>participation</b> for most students in a class
of this size, so we'll factor engagement on various things we ask you
to do (e.g., filling out our surveys, properly recording partner names
on projects, etc).

<p>At the end of the semester, we'll look at the distribution of scores
and set a curve, with thresholds for each letter grade.  The goal is
to make the grading fair across semesters (even as we experiment with
harder or easier projects).  We'll also use our own discretion when
setting the thresholds.  For example, if everybody produces good
results, we won't fail some students just for the purpose of the
curve.

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>Exams are closed-book and closed-laptop.  The exams will be
  multiple-choice scantron (use a #2 pencil).

<p>You will be allowed one 8.5-by-11 inch notesheet (handwritten only,
  both sides), which you must turn in with your exam.  Later material
  builds on earlier material, so the exams will be necessarily be
  cumulative.

<p>If you need special accomodations for exams (or other components of
  the course), please let us know.  We'll do our best to accomodate you.

<p>Times/Locations: TBD

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p><b>Late Policy:</b> You will have 5 late days, which you can use
  across projects at your own discretion.  You may use all your late
  days on the same project, if you like.  Using late days on a project
  does not defer the deadline for subsequent projects, so be careful
  not to let work pile up.  You <b>may not</b> use late days on the
  last project.  Late days are automatically applied if a project is
  turned in late (you may reclaim late days by withdrawing earlier
  projects).  After late days are exhausted, anything late will
  receive zero credit.  However, we encourage you to talk with the
  instructor for your section if you're having trouble keeping up or
  there are any special factors requiring extensions (e.g., documented
  illness).  The hope is that everybody keeps pace!

<p><b>Partners:</b> You may work alone, or with one project partner of
  your choosing.  You can partner with different people for different
  projects if you like.  You may also partner with people in a
  different section of CS 301.  You and your partner should program in
  pairs (two people sitting in front of a screen at the same time).
  Take turns driving (i.e., writing code) and giving advice.  The
  point of partners is to learn from your peers, not to do half the
  work.  Some exam questions will be specifically written to find
  cases where a one partner does the work and the other partner does
  not understand what is going on.

<p><b>Submission:</b> You will upload either a .py file or a .ipynb
  (as specified) file for each project with
  the <a href="submission.html">submission tool</a>.  Only one partner
  should upload the project on behalf of both people.

<p><b>Code Review:</b> A TA will give you detailed comments on
  specific parts of your assignment.  This feedback process is called
  a "code review", and is a common requirement in industry before a
  programmer is allowed to add her code changes to the main codebase.
  Read your code reviews carefully; even if you receive 100% on your
  work, we'll often give you tips to save effort in the future.

<p><b>Project Grading:</b> Grades will be based on automatic tests
  that we run.  We'll share the tests with you before the due date, so
  you should rarely be surprised by your grade.  Here are the cases
  where you might get a different final grade than what you see when
  you run the tests:

  <ol>
    <li><b>Configuration Issues:</b> There are ways to write code that
      will only work on certain computers (e.g., Windows but not on a
      Mac).  We'll talk about these cases in class and teach you to
      write code that should be able to run anywhere.  If you make a
      mistake that makes the tests fail for us even though you passed
      them yourself, we'll let you resubmit a corrected version (in a
      timely fashion).
    <li><b>Randomness:</b> There are some bugs in code that don't
      causes problems every time, resulting in tests sometimes failing
      and sometimes passing.  As in the "Configuration Issues" case,
      we'll work with you to let you fix the issue.
    <li><b>Cheating:</b> obviously if you cheated (e.g., copied
      another student's code), the tests are irrelevant, and you have
      much bigger things to worry about than your grade on a particular
      assignment.
    <li><b>Faking:</b> sometimes, we will specify that you solve a
      problem in a specific way (so that you learn a particular skill).
      If, upon inspection of your code, we see you solved the problem in
      a way that doesn't meet the project specification, you'll lose
      points on that project (even if our automatic tests already
      tentatively gave you a better score).  Or, if your code is written
      specifically to defeat the tests, you'll lose points
      (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">this
        wikipedia article</a> for an example of a defeat device in the
      real world).  For example, suppose your program is supposed to
      take the length of a square's side as input and then output the
      area of a square, and we have a test that verifies your program
      outputs 100 when we input 10.  If you submit a program that always
      outputs 100 (regardless of the input) because you know we only
      test with 10, you'll lose points.
    <li><b>Being a bad partner:</b> if your partner complains that you
      didn't do any work (or that you did all the work, refusing to let
      your partner write any code), you may lose points (we'll meet with
      you first to hear your side, of course).
  </ol>

<p>Project grading is <b>results-oriented</b>.  That means it doesn't
matter how much effort you put it; it only matters how well your code
works.  This means it is essential that your code runs.  If we can't
run your code for a project, you'll get a zero on that project,
because the tests will fail.  We'll never fix the code for you, and
we'll never manually give a better grade for code that "looks" almost
correct.

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>Yeah, of course you shouldn't cheat, but what is cheating?  This
  may not be obvious to people taking a CS course for the first time,
  so everybody should read this.  The most common form of academic
  misconduct in these classes involves copying code for programming
  projects.  Here's an overview of what you can and cannot do:

<p><b>Acceptable</b>
<ul>
  <li>any collaboration with your project partner
  <li>talking about code (without looking at it or reading it aloud) with anybody
  <li>sharing pseudocode/diagrams with anybody
  <li>pointing friends to online resources (Piazza, Stackoverflow, etc.)
  <li>doing worksheets with friends
  <li>copying code examples from online examples that is NOT specific to your project (if project solutions are leaked online, you may not use that).  If you copy code, you must cite it in your code with a comment (think of it like citing a quote in a essay -- without the cite, you're plagarizing).
</ul>

<p><b>NOT Acceptable</b>
<ul>
  <li>looking at somebody else's project code and typing it line-by-line
  <li>copying/pasting code to/from a non-partner (with our without citation)
  <li>emailing your code to another student
  <li>taking pictures of project solutions
</ul>

<p>One action that students wonder about is whether it's acceptable to
LOOK at another student's code.  While this is not strictly forbidden,
it's often dangerous.  Many students find it difficult to look without
ultimately copying.  What's somewhat safer is when a student who has
completed a problem looks at the code of a student still working on
the problem.  In this case, the more-advanced student can often
provide useful advice and debugging tips that help the less-advanced
student without causing the less-advanced student to copy code.  Just
make sure the more-advanced student isn't telling the less-advanced
student exactly what to type, line by line.

<p><b>Similarity Detection:</b> of course, with 500 students, it's
hard for a human TA to notice similar code across two submissions.
Thus, we use automated tools to looks for similarities across
submissions.  Such similarity detection is an active area of computer
science research, and the result is tools that detect code copying
even when students methodically rename all variables and shuffle the
order of their code.  We take cheating detection seriously to make the
course fair to students who put in the honest effort.

<p><b>Citing Code:</b> you can copy small snippets of code from
stackoverflow (and other online references) if you cite them.  For
example, suppose I need to write some code that gets the median number
from a list of numbers.  I might search for "how to get the median of
a list in python" and find a solution
at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python</a>.

<p>I could (legitimately) post code from that page in my code, as long as
  it has a comment as follows:

<pre class="example">
  # code copied from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24101524/finding-median-of-list-in-python
  def median(lst):
    sortedLst = sorted(lst)
    lstLen = len(lst)
    index = (lstLen - 1) // 2

    if (lstLen % 2):
      return sortedLst[index]
    else:
      return (sortedLst[index] + sortedLst[index + 1])/2.0
</pre>

<p>In contrast, copying from a nearly complete project (that
accomplishes what you're trying to do for your project) is not OK.
When in doubt, ask us!  The best way to stay out of trouble is to be
completely transparent about what you're doing.
