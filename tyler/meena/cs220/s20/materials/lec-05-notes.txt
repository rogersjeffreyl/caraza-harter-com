SLIDES: intro
========================================

DEMO 1 (short, I'll show the basics of how to use some variables, then talk about different errors you might see)

# DO IN INTERACTIVE MODE

# basic assignment
x = 2
print(x)
x
x + 1
x
x = 9
x

========================================

# PythonTutor, Live Mode

Convert problem 2 of pseudocode worksheet to Python code (use "i" and "o").  Introduce comments.

Compare with:
 - worksheet
 - Downey (he uses arrows instead of boxes);
   show "render all objects on the heap" option

Talk about syntactic sugar (+= and -=)

========================================

# ERRORS (still in PythonTutor)

2 = x            # syntax ERROR!

# need to assign before using
print(y)         # runtime ERROR! (NameError is an example of a runtime error)
y = 3
print(y)
x * y
x ^ 2            # semantic ERROR! (runs but gives wrong output, assuming I wanted an exponent)
                 # bitwise exclusive or, not necessary for us to learn in CS 301

# let's talk briefly about these kinds of errors...

SLIDES: types of errors
========================================

DEMO 2 (variables containing different types)

# DO IN SCRIPT MODE (will be online later)

========================================
# INTS

# it it even?
n = 5
n % 2      # ask students what it will be (try diff n vals)
n % 2 == 0 # what type?  what is the meaning?

# what is the sum of all the odd numbers?
a = 3
b = 5
c = 2
d = 1

# BAD WAY!  write code that does't break if data changes
total = a + b + d

# GOOD WAY
total = a*(a%2) + b*(b%2) + c*(c%2) + d*(d%2) # better

print(total)

========================================
# FLOATS

# average

x = 6
y = 8
z = 7
avg = (x + y + z) / 3

# how to compute compound growth (investments)

start = 1000
interest = 7
years = 30

yearly_mult = 1 + interest / 100
final = start * yearly_mult**years
print(final)  # make them guess how much

========================================
# STRINGS

# string operations
first = 'Ada'
last = 'Lovelace'
player1 = first + last
player1
first = 'Alice'
player1 # does player1 change if we change first now?

# show an example with two players, and bars showing the magnitude of their scores
player2 = 'bob'
score1 = 10
score2 = 8
print(player1 + ': ' + '|' * score1)
print(player2 + ': ' + '|' * score2)

========================================
# BOOLS

# assignment vs equality (in interactive mode)
x
y
y > x
y = x
x
y
x == y
x = 2
x == y

# bounds checking (in script mode)
valid = 0 < x < 100
print('you may continue: ' + valid)       # oops!
print('you may continue: ' + str(valid))  # change type

========================================

# naming sensitivity
val = 1
Val = 2
VAL = 3
_val = 4

# naming rules
n = 1
class = 301 # keyword!
class_301 = 'awesome'
301class = 'awesome'
hey! = 'nope'
_test = 1
Ã± = 1

DEMO 2 (other demos, as time permits...)

========================================

# volume of a sphere given radius
volume = 4/3 * PI * radius**3

# radius of a sphere given volume
volume = 4/3 * PI * radius**3

========================================

# quadratic formula
 - positive only (then adapt for negative)
 a = 3
 b = 2
 c = -1
 numerator = -b + (b**2 - 4*a*c) ** (1/2)
 denominator = 2 * c
 x = numerator / denominator
 a*(x**2) + b*(x) + c
 - negative
 - make it imaginary, talk about that
